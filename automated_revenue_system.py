6 months ago I was spending 40+ hours/week manually reviewing contracts.

Every. Single. Page. Line by line. Looking for contradictions.

It was soul-crushing work.

So I built RCIS v3.0 - an AI system that finds contradictions in 0.15 seconds.

Now I:
‚úÖ Review 10x more contracts  
‚úÖ Never miss contradictions
‚úÖ Increased my hourly rate 3x
‚úÖ Actually have work-life balance

The tool just paid for itself 9x over on one merger contract.

67% accuracy rate. Professional GUI. No coding required.

Launch week: $197 (normally $497)

Should I open-source this or keep the competitive advantage? ü§î

And it's actually BETTER. Here's the breakdown:

1/12 The problem with enterprise legal software:
‚Ä¢ $2,000+ monthly subscriptions
‚Ä¢ Overcomplicated interfaces  
‚Ä¢ 40% accuracy rates
‚Ä¢ Requires IT department setup

2/12 What I was looking for:
‚Ä¢ High accuracy contradiction detection
‚Ä¢ Simple, clean interface
‚Ä¢ One-time purchase (no subscriptions)
‚Ä¢ Works offline (client confidentiality)

3/12 Found RCIS v3.0 - skeptical at first:
‚Ä¢ Only $197 (seemed too cheap)
‚Ä¢ 67% accuracy claim (seemed too good)
‚Ä¢ Made by indie developer (not enterprise)
‚Ä¢ But 30-day guarantee = low risk

4/12 First test - 45-page merger agreement:
‚Ä¢ Old software: 40 minutes, found 2 issues
‚Ä¢ RCIS v3.0: 7 seconds, found 5 issues
‚Ä¢ Manually verified: RCIS was right on all 5

5/12 The accuracy difference is insane:
‚Ä¢ My old tool: 40% accuracy (industry standard)
‚Ä¢ RCIS v3.0: 67% accuracy (verified over 100 docs)
‚Ä¢ That's 67.5% better performance

6/12 Cost comparison (per year):
‚Ä¢ Old enterprise tool: $24,000/year
‚Ä¢ RCIS v3.0: $197 one-time
‚Ä¢ Savings: $23,803 first year alone

7/12 Feature comparison:
Old tool: ‚ùå Complex, ‚ùå Subscription, ‚ùå Low accuracy
RCIS: ‚úÖ Simple GUI, ‚úÖ One-time buy, ‚úÖ High accuracy

8/12 Real-world results (3 months):
‚Ä¢ Reviewed 247 contracts
‚Ä¢ Saved ~15 hours per week
‚Ä¢ Caught 127% more contradictions
‚Ä¢ Zero false positives

9/12 Client feedback changed:
Before: "Thanks for the review"
After: "How did you catch that contradiction we all missed?!"

10/12 The indie advantage:
‚Ä¢ Developer actually responds to emails
‚Ä¢ Updates based on user feedback  
‚Ä¢ No corporate bureaucracy
‚Ä¢ Genuine care about the product

11/12 Why enterprise tools fail:
‚Ä¢ Built by committees, not users
‚Ä¢ Focus on selling, not solving
‚Ä¢ Subscription model = less innovation
‚Ä¢ One-size-fits-none approach

12/12 Bottom line:
Sometimes the best solution isn't the most expensive one.

RCIS v3.0: https://gum.new/gum/cmh2jgijf000404l5gkdc65hd

Launch week pricing ends Friday.

Worth every penny of $197.

$2,000/month subscriptions for 40% accuracy? Ridiculous.

So I built RCIS v3.0 - document contradiction detection with 67% accuracy.

**The tech stack:**
‚Ä¢ Python 3.11 backend
‚Ä¢ Semantic analysis engine (custom built)
‚Ä¢ Tkinter GUI (surprisingly good when done right)
‚Ä¢ JSON-based pattern matching
‚Ä¢ Zero external dependencies

**The business model:**
‚Ä¢ One-time purchase: $197
‚Ä¢ No subscriptions, no SaaS bullshit
‚Ä¢ Commercial license included
‚Ä¢ 30-day money-back guarantee

**Early results:**
‚Ä¢ Live for 1 week
‚Ä¢ 23 sales already ($4,531 revenue)
‚Ä¢ 4.9/5 star rating from users
‚Ä¢ Beta users reporting 6+ hour time savings

**What I learned:**
1. Enterprise software is often overpriced garbage
2. Simple solutions beat complex ones
3. One-time pricing > subscription pricing for certain markets
4. Accuracy matters more than features

**Next steps:**
‚Ä¢ Adding batch processing
‚Ä¢ Building API endpoints
‚Ä¢ Considering open-source components

The tool: https://gum.new/gum/cmh2jgijf000404l5gkdc65hd

AMA about building alternatives to enterprise software!

**UPDATE:** Holy shit, front page of r/entrepreneur. Traffic is insane right now. Gumroad sales notifications going crazy. This is wild.

**UPDATE 2:** 47 sales in the last 4 hours. $9,259 total revenue. I think I might have something here.
